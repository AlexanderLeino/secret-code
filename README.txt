Here is my pseudo code I started with:


I need to create a password generator that generates a password 25 charactesr long.
When the user clicks the "generate-password button" get recieves a PROMPT asking if he would like to generate a password. 
Questions:
How many characters would you like your password to contain?
Click okay to CONFIRM incling special characters.
Numberic Characters?
Would you like your password to have upperCaseLetters? 
Would you like your password to have lowerCaseLetters?

Then I would like to verify the users choices
Then I want to create a container that holds the selected elements that I will be able to select form


My biggest hurdle was assigning values into the newArray that the user selected.
but it seemed pretty simple after I found out I could concat arrays and then assigned the values I took from one array and add them to the other. by doing 
-->newArray = newArray.concat(variable that was assigned the array we are concating from)

Sorry had to reupload because my other repos git pages wasnt working correctly!!!!!
